# Support.Dashboards
Dashboards for the Product Support team

These are built on Ruby and Smashing (https://smashing.github.io/).

Currently live on ps-russelld but I will move them to a proper deployment soonâ„¢.

## Settings
Settings required to run are stored in a separate config.yml file. You will need to create this file locally in the root directory.

### This requires:
* url : "https://pathto.zendesk.com/api/v2" eg https://redgatesupport.zendesk.com/api/v2
* username : "zendesk username"
* token : "zendesk api token"
